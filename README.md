Diode laser power and temperature stabilization


# Introduction üìù
Technological progress gives people incredible abilities. What seemed impossible for people of past centuries is now commonplace for every person. Lasers are one of those everyday things. Complex engineering and technical systems that require the creation and maintenance of appropriate means of control and management are now subject to every person. 

Laser radiation technologies are actively developing and, due to a wide range of physical and operating characteristics, are used in many different areas: information technology, industry, environmental monitoring, and medicine. This scale of application is associated primarily with the unique features of laser radiation, which, in turn, gives a high level of monochromaticity, coherence and directivity. Such indicators are unattainable by any other energy sources. ‚ÄúWith the help of lasers, it is possible to provide extremely high concentrations of energy both in space, close to the conditions at the epicenter of a nuclear explosion and in the center of stars, and in time, providing such a high power (peak) and intensity of the light beam that when such beams interact with materials Fundamentally new physical effects arise‚Äù (A.S. Boreisho, S.V. Ivakin ‚ÄúLasers: device and action‚Äù).
